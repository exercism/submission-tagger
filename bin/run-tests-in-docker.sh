# Synopsis:
# Test the submission tagger Docker image by running it against a predefined set of 
# submissions with an expected output.
# The Docker image is built automatically.

# Arguments:
# $1: track slug (optional)
# $2: submission slug (optional)

# Output:
# Outputs the diff of the expected tags against the actual tags
# generated by the submission tagger Docker image.

# Example:
# ./bin/run-tests-in-docker.sh

# Example running all tests:
# ./bin/run-tests-in-docker.sh

# Example running single test:
# ./bin/run-tests-in-docker.sh single-file
