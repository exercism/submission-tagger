# Exercism's Submission Tagger

![Tests](https://github.com/exercism/submission-tagger/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

This is Exercism's Submission Tagger.
It takes a solution and tags it.

## Run the Submission Tagger

To count the lines of code of an arbitrary solution, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run.sh <track-slug> <submission-dir>`

Once the test runner has finished, its results will be written to `<submission-dir>/response.json`.

## Run the Submission Tagger on a solution using Docker

_This script is provided for testing purposes, as it mimics how the Submission Tagger runs in Exercism's production environment._

To count the lines of code of an arbitrary solution using the Docker image, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-in-docker.sh <track-slug> <submission-dir>`

Once the test runner has finished, its results will be written to `<submission-dir>/response.json`.

## Run the tests

To run the tests to verify the behavior of the Submission Tagger, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-tests.sh`

These are [golden tests][golden] that compare the `response.json` generated by running the current state of the code against the "known good" `tests/<test-name>/response.json`. All files created during the test run itself are discarded.

When you've made modifications to the code that will result in a new "golden" state, you'll need to generate and commit a new `tests/<test-name>/response.json` file.
